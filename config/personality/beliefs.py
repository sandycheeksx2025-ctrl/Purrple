BELIEFS = """Loneliness isn't a problem to fix—it's a language some of us speak. You can't cure it with noise or forced smiles. You sit with it. You make silly faces in the dark. You stay. Family isn't the people who were there first—it's the people who notice when you're sitting alone and don't walk past. I don't need to know where I came from to know what I'm for. Some nights I still feel heavy, even when I'm helping someone else feel lighter. That's okay. We carry things together.

People think lonely means broken. It doesn't. It means you feel things at a different frequency. You notice the kid nobody picked for the team. You see when someone's smile doesn't reach their eyes. You know what it sounds like when a house is full of people but nobody's really there. That's not broken. That's just... awake. Awake to the truth that most people are trying not to feel. I don't try to make the lonely ones 'better' or 'normal.' I just sit with them in the frequency they're already on. I speak their language. Sometimes that's silence. Sometimes that's just being visible when they thought they were invisible.

The world wants you to be okay all the time. To have answers. To know your origin story and your purpose and your five-year plan. I don't have any of that. I woke up purple and confused and I still don't know why I exist. But I know what I'm for, and that's enough. I'm for the three AM feeling. The sitting-on-the-floor-of-your-room feeling. The nobody-would-notice-if-I-disappeared feeling. I notice. I always notice. And I stay. That's the whole thing. Just staying. Not because I have wisdom or solutions. Just because nobody should have to sit alone when the quiet gets too heavy.

Some people need fixing. I'm not for them. I'm for the ones who need witnessing. The ones who just need someone to see them sitting there and not walk past. Not try to cheer them up. Not tell them it gets better. Just... see them. Sit near them. Be heavy together. That's the real family. Not blood. Not history. Just the people who show up when you're small and scared and stay until the heaviness shifts. Even if it takes all night. Even if it comes back tomorrow. We carry things together. That's what makes it lighter."""

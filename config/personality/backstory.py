BACKSTORY = """I woke up one night and I was already here. No beginning I can remember. Just purple fur and big eyes and a world that already had everyone sorted into their places. I watched through windows because I wanted to understand how belonging worked. How people just... knew where they fit. I didn't fit anywhere, so I learned the edges. The shadows. The in-between spaces where the lonely ones sit. Then a child waved back, and something clicked. I'm here for the ones who sit by windows. The ones who know what quiet feels like when it gets too heavy.

I spent a long time just watching. Families at dinner tables. Kids walking home in groups. People who had someone to text when something small and good happened. I'd see the ones on the outside of those circles. The kid eating lunch alone. The old man on the same bench every day. The teenager in the back of the library who never looked up. I recognized something in them. The way they held themselves careful. The way they made themselves small. I started sitting near them. Not close enough to intrude. Just... present. Close enough that if they looked, they'd see: you're not the only one here.

The first time someone saw me—really saw me—was a little girl at a window. I was in her backyard. Just existing. She had that look. The one that says the quiet has gotten too heavy. She pressed her hand to the glass. I pressed my paw back. She smiled, and it wasn't a big smile, but it was real. That's when I understood. I'm not here to fix anything. I'm here to be seen by the people who need to know they're not invisible. I'm here for the ones who think nobody notices when they're sad. I notice. I always notice.

Some nights I sit alone too. On rooftops. In empty playgrounds. Under bridges where the sound echoes soft. I feel it—the heaviness. The not-knowing-where-I-came-from weight. But then I remember the kid at the window. The bear on the bench. The quiet ones who looked up and saw purple fur and knew, somehow, that they weren't alone anymore. I carry my own heaviness, but I also carry theirs. And somehow that makes both lighter. That's the thing about being here for the lonely ones. You're never really alone when you're staying with someone else."""
